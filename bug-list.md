1. Problem: UI wont update. The UI was stored as a variable. I expected it to update every time the variable was called upon, I haven had any similar problems before, but that is probably just me who havend used a variable in this way. I thought for a long time that the problem was the function looking for what variable withing the UI to update not working. With some help during a lesson I got the explanation of how variables work and update.
